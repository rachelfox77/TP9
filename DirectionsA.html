    <li>Slice the Spam into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a ziploc bag.</li>
    <li>Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness.</li>
    <li>Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface, shiny side down.</li>
    <li>Place your Musubi mold across the middle of the nori and add sushi rice to the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly, so there is about 1 to 1 1/2 inches of rice.</li>
    <li>Remove the mold from the rice. You should have a nice little block of rice right on top of the nori.</li>
    <li>Add a slice of cooked Spam on top of the rice block.</li>
    <li>Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the Spam, then wrap up the other side. Use water on your finger to seal the nori if needed.</li>
    <li>Serve warm.</li>
